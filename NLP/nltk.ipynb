Primary pollutants are those attacking the fresh air directly and released from smoke, ash, dust, fumes, mist, spray, inorganic gases, carbon dioxide, ammonia, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and radioactive compounds. Secondary pollutants are those influencing the air indirectly by biochemical interactions to the principal pollutants and other atmospheric constituents such as sulfur-trioxide, ozone, hydrocarbons, nitrogen dioxide\")\r\n",
